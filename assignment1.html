                Here's my circuit! (Note: I initially ran into a problem with uploading my code so although my setup should've theoretically worked, it didn't originally display properly. But the circuit got fixed eventually!)
            </p>

                This is the circuit before turning it on.

            <p>
                This is the schematic that I drew for the circuit, as well as my calculations for how I decided on the resistance to use.

                Finally, here's my code snippet for this assignment:
                <pre>
                    <code>
// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
    // initialize digital pins 13, 12, and 11 as outputs.
    pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
    pinMode(12, OUTPUT);
    pinMode(11, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
    digitalWrite(13, HIGH);   // turn the LED on that is connected to pin 13 (HIGH is the voltage level)
    delay(750);                       // wait for 3 quarters of a second
    digitalWrite(12, HIGH);   // turn the LED on that is connected to pin 12 (HIGH is the voltage level)
    delay(100);                       // wait for a tenth of a second
    digitalWrite(11, HIGH);   // turn the LED on that is connected to pin 11 (HIGH is the voltage level)
    digitalWrite(13, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
    delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
    digitalWrite(12, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
    delay(500);                         // wait for half a second
    digitalWrite(11, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
    delay(1500);                       // wait for a second and a half
}
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </p>
