                Here's my circuit! You can't actually hear it in the gif, so here's the actual <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=11K7uHXRc58RDedFhg9pCcTJiKLM_Jn8v">link.</a>

                This was my sketch of what I planned to make!

            <p>
                And this is what it looked like originally when I wired it. I quickly realized this was unfeasible due to limitations in wire length and size of the breadboard.

            <p>
                So I modified it!

                This is what it looks like on the outside.

                This is the schematic that I drew for the circuit!
